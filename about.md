title: Hey! Iâ€™m Thomas. 
---

I'm a Berlin based techie.

I fix broken stuff. Some of it I didn't even break myself.

I'm an agile manifesto missionary, a dog person, a gamer that can't git gud, an ex-musician and a coffee nerd. Probably a few other things, too.

I write about startups, projects I've worked on and tech that should be killed with fire.

One day, I aspire to write meaningful about me pages.
Until then, feel free to hit me up @ thomas@quitty.tech
